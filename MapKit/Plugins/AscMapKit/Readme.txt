Ascentroid Map Kit
******************

This is an Unreal Engine plugin used to create campaigns (maps/levels) for Ascentroid.

The latest stable source can be found here:
https://github.com/Ascentroid/Ascentroid/tree/latest-stable

There is also an Ascentroid Map Kit Tool which can help you with organizing campaigns and MODs. Download here:
[todo: add download url later]

Warning: do NOT edit any assets in this map kit plugin. Any changes you make to them will NOT show up in-game. That's
because the map kit plugin is loaded at game runtime and is NOT included in any campaign/MOD pak files you create (to
save on disk space). Therefore, you should not edit any of the assets inside this plugin. You have been warned! :)
